I know a funny little man as quiet as a mouse
Who does the mischief that is done in everybody's house
yet no one ever sees his face and yet we all agree
that every plate we break was cracked by Mr Nobody
I think I know somebody that does the mischief we are talking about here
And I know somebody who might have cracked the plate too.
